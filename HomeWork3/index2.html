            In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or
            trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the
            definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants
            with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants
            above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms,
            tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees.

            A jungle is land covered with dense forest and tangled vegetation,
            usually in tropical climates. Application of the term has varied
            greatly during the past recent century.

            Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species
            of primate. They are a type of great ape that is characterized by
            bipedalism and exceptional cognitive skills due to a large and
            complex brain. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex
            social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups,
            from families and kinship networks to political states. As such,
            social interactions between humans have established a wide variety
            of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which
            bolsters human society. The desire to understand and influence
            phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science,
            technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other conceptual
            frameworks.

            Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
            "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also
            to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only,
            part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity
            is often understood as a separate category from other natural
            phenomena.

            The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
            mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family
            Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat
            to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are
            commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats;
            the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic
            cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to
            kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
            registries.[6]
